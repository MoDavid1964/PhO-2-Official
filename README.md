# (PhO)^2 Official Website Developer Documentation

## Configuring the Website

Coding the second iteration of the official (PhO)^2 website was no easy task; nevertheless, the process was expedited and made way easier thanks to frameworks (the first iteration relied on vanilla php and javascript, which was a TERRIBLE project idea for a solo developer like me). Anyhow, a downside presents itself with this website architecture in mind: the learning curves associated with frameworks are much sharper, and for none-practicing programmers like most of yourselves (?), understanding how to implement this website may take some time. However, it does, nevertheless, spare everyone the pain of debugging some hairs along the way, and honestly the bootup process is way easier thanks to this. Without further ado, I will now outline the things you should do in order to set this up correctly. And no, I will no longer be paying for the Amazon Web Services needed to host this website. The billing fucked my card (that's a joke). I will still pay for the domain name though (for that, just contact me when necessary). With regard to any possible problems encountered along the way, don't hesitate to contact me directly (although please reserve such occassions to only the most urgent ones).

## Website UI

There exists two versions of the official UI. Developments on the appaearance and usability of this UI will continue to be implemented so long as they are needed, although these are not of prime focus. The two versions of UI are distinguished by their color palettes and help indicate whether a user has administrative priviliges or not. 

### Admin UI

The admin UI is currently indicated by its predominantly red-shifted palette. A tab for modifying other user accounts and the website problem data bank also exists. 

### User UI

The User UI is more or less self-explanatory. More features may be added, depending on the free time of the developer.
